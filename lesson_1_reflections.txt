How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It took some time to carefully look and find the bug. 
    It compared two versions of a file and showed the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

     Save all the version of a file in version control system and retrieve it as needed.  It is easy to backup. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: have lesser number of versions and easy to find the logical purpose of the change.
    cons: forget to commit or loss the changes before commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because Git is manual commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Use git log to see the history of commit. 
   Use git diff to view the history of changes in files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always get the older versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To save the files in different versions.
