When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share with others


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because I may not always need the up-to-date version of remote repository


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is the copy of repository in gitHub. We would use it when we want to copy/clone someone's repository in gitHub.
clones is also the copy of repository between gitHub and local machine, or between local machines.  
branches is creating a new branch in the same repository either in gitHub or in local repository.

  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can see the new changes that get updated in remote or locally
